üéä **I've got a new personal site!** üçæ Fully equipped with a blog for which I plan on writing about various topics:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Vue.js, React, & Angular
- Clean Code
- Design Patterns
- Tooling & DX
- Practical Tutorials
- Book Reviews
- & more!

This site is built with:

- Gatsby
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- StellerCSS
- Netlify
- Google Cloud Platform

I know, [software is supposed to be boring](https://tqdev.com/2018-the-boring-software-manifesto), and one is not supposed to get excited and glorify shiny new tech such as my above list, but I must say, this is my first time using Gatsby, and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Having used Nuxt & Next before, and having good experiences with each, the Gatsby ecosystem seems signifigantly more mature (at least at the time of writing this). Using TypeScript is a breeze, documentation is robust, community tutorials and guides are abundant, and "weird errors" are rarely experienced. In fact, I haven't had to resort to copy pasting a single error message into Google yet, which to me, is a pretty good indicator in my opinion.

Anyway, thanks for checking out my new site! üëã
