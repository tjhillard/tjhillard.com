üéä **I've got a new personal site!** üçæ Fully equipped with a blog, where I plan on writing about topics such as:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- CSS
- JS Frameworks
- Node
- Clean Code
- Design Patterns
- Tooling & DX
- Practical Tutorials
- Book Reviews
- & more!

This site is built with:

- Gatsby
- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- StellerCSS
- Netlify
- Google Cloud Platform

I know, [software is supposed to be boring](https://tqdev.com/2018-the-boring-software-manifesto), and one is not supposed to get excited and glorify shiny new tech such as my above list, but I must say, this is my first time using Gatsby, and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with. Having used Nuxt & Next before, and having good experiences with each, the Gatsby ecosystem seems signifigantly more mature (at least at the time of writing this). Using TypeScript is a breeze, documentation is robust, community tutorials and guides are abundant, and "weird errors" are rarely experienced.

I'm using React & TypeScript for my JavaScript stack (I love TypeScript, and if you work with me you probably already know that I use it for almost everything), GraphQL for the Gatsby data layer, my own [Steller CSS](https://github.com/tjhillard/steller-css) for the CSS framework, Netlify for hosting and analytics, and finally, Google Cloud Platform for image/file storage.

Thanks for taking the time to check out my new site! If you're interested in viewing the source code, it's all open source [on my GitHub](https://github.com/tjhillard/tjhillard.com). Feel free to drop a follow or a star while you're there. üòâ
